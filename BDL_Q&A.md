## Q: What are the key properties of a cryptographically secure hash function?
A: ​A **hash function** ​is a mathematical function with the following three properties:
- Its **input** can be any **string of any size**
- It produces a **fixed size output**
- It is **efficiently computable**

Intuitively the last point means that for a given input string you can figure out what the output of the hash function is in a reasonable amount of time More technically computing the hash of an ​n​‐bit string should have a running time that is O(​n​).

Those properties define a general hash function while a **​cryptographic ​hash functions**, to be cryptographically secure, has the following three additional 
properties: (1) **collision‐resistance**, (2) **hiding**, (3)**puzzle‐friendliness**:
