# Cyber and Computer Law Questions & Answers

## Q: What is the main difference between AI and HI?
A:
- They can both propose solution, but AI is not good at **posing questions**;  
- AI is good at **efficiency**, has a lot of computation power, not the same for HI but HI can be **creative**, it can can judge; 
- AI doesn’t have **curiosity/interest**; 
- Hermeneutics: machines does not have the art of **interpretation**;
- Memory intensity: both have memory but machine cannot **‘recordare’**, because they have no heart; 
- AI and programmed entities like algorithms, computers and machine in general follow programs (living beings also), but humans **project** things. 

## Q: Why would we want to pursue a high level of AI?
A: Pursuing a high level of AI promises **efficiency** through automation, breakthroughs in complex problem-solving, personalized services, predictive capabilities for better decision-making, improved quality of life through healthcare advancements, and enhanced global competitiveness. Ethical AI development also aims to mitigate biases and promote transparency, ensuring responsible deployment for societal benefit.

## Q: What is the problem with considering efficiency as the most important aspect of AI?
A: Intelligent machines only need to pursue the best operational efficiency, discarding all that dimension that slow down the process. So **wondering** (*interrogarsi*), making mistakes, hanging things without pursuing a certain goal, repenting, developing a conviction are activities that are fundamentally based on the use of time by wasting it. These activities cannot be technically optimized without being distorted.

## Q: Why even if technology is becoming more and more refined, why isn’t there this ability to ask questions, to be curious?
A: Curiosity involves creativity, intuition, and a desire to understand the unknown, aspects of cognition that remain uniquely human and are not easily replicated by artificial intelligence. Our intelligence, not only has the negative side of solving problems, but a positive and creative side, which is that of posing problems, asking questions, doubting. 

## Q: What is ”surviving” (need to apprehend something) connected to?

## Q: What is inter-est?
A: Humans learn driven by *inter-est*. The word **est** comes from the verb ”**to be**”, **inter** means ”**inside**”, therefore it means ”**to be in the same situation/in the same boat**”, it’s driven by interest, by something that is within us, that is by being already, always involved in existence and coexistence with others.

## Q: What is the difference between mechanism and metabolism?
A: Being an organism and not a mechanism is differentiated by the fact of **having a body**, a metabolism, this fact has to do deeply with our intelligence, it’s an important sign that these two forms of intelligence (mechanism and metabolism) are distinguished and cannot be assumed together. Every living organism has a metabolism and it consumes itself and it goes toward an end, death. Heidegger's concept of "Sein-zum-Tode" or "**being-towards-death**" underscores the existential dimension of organisms: living beings, unlike mere mechanisms, are aware of their **mortality**, which influences their behaviors, goals, and **projects** in life. It signifies that organisms, including humans, possess a unique form of intelligence characterized by purpose, urgency, hope, and the capacity to shape their lives within the constraints of existence. This existential awareness distinguishes organisms from mere mechanical systems and underscores their capacity to engage actively with the world through projects and aspirations. The fact that we know that we are living beings but our time is limited makes us activate
towards our project. 

## Q: Sense (sensus) and meaning
A: We build our experience through, first of all, senses. ”Sense” is a term that expresses a way of **accessing something in the most primordial mode**, through the senses (touch, taste, smell, hearing, sight). But sense is also at the same time the most abstract and general mode possible, that is **seeking the meaning**. When we seek a sense in something, we recognize something further than simply having experienced it, and we want to make it communicable and comprehensible to others. Differently from machines, humans seek the meaning that goes beyond the mere functioning, we have seen the inexplicable link between senses, experience and the search of meaning.

## Q: Experiencing vs experimenting
A: Experience is something that a **human experience with his sense**, for example going for a ride experience something. Different is experimenting because it means that a **human try to do something which is unforeseen (*imprevisto*)**, but in this case is something that is always repeatable replicable and demonstrable while an experience is not repeatable because is not always the same. 
We can look at these observations giving this example: imagine to bring 4 different people in front of a telescope and asking them to describe the experience of watching the moon. The same scene can be read differently, we say that we have different interpretative layers depending on the question asked by those two observe it.

## Q: How do we make experience transmissible with others?

## Q: How do we give meaning and purpose to our action, that goes beyond the mere surviving?


## Q: What is the difference between human laws and the ones that we’ve already found?
A: Apart from those laws that order the natural cycles, so spring, summer, ... the laws of biology, the laws that we have already found, that if we water a plant it grows, apart from these laws, all the other type of laws, **human laws have to be expressed in words**. There are no norms that can do without their formulation in words, even the scientific laws are explained and expressed in words, so there is always the need of the mediation of the logos, nobody understands math only watching number changing but we need someone to explain how it works. 

## Q: Can an animal or plant feel injustice?
A: Animals can experience unfair treatment and stress due to certain actions, though they do not conceptualize it as "injustice" in the same philosophical or ethical sense humans do.

## Q: Law vs justice, how do you connect human laws with human words, why are they so connected?
A: Justice is something that we can never write it down once and for all, there's no arrival but just a path, **justice is based on the principle of equality**.  Instead, legality is something that we can find, it's basically all the rules and norms that are valid in a certain period of time in a certain area, they can change what is legal.

## Q: What is the difference between symbolic and numerical code/language?

## Q: What about the errors? What is the difference between a machine incurring in an error and a human incurring in an error?
A: In mankind, error is also the origin of many inventions, of discoveries, of new ideas, why? **Curiosity**. The idea is that a man has a type of rationality that is not closed only in the solution of the problem and error can be a starting point for something else; 
In contrast, machines typically respond to errors by adjusting their behavior within predefined parameters to achieve a desired outcome.

## Q: What about the unexpected and the unforeseen, how do we deal with this structural situation of living? What about surprise/the uncertainty, how do these conditions impact our life and how do we react?
A: The unexpected and the unforeseen are those dimensions that connote respectively and at the same time:
- the failure of an experiment;
- the enrichment of an experience.

So wondering, making mistakes, hanging things without pursuing a certain goal, repenting (*pentendosi*), developing a conviction are activities that are fundamentally based on the use of time by wasting it.

## Q: Why are there facts and not interpretation of facts? Why do we say that facts are not something given once and for all, but that they go hand-in-hand with who sees the facts and wants to discuss them?
A: There are no facts, only interpretation because we say that facts must be stated by someone, affirmed by someone and facts cannot speak for themselves.

## Q: What is absolute knowledge? How does this absolute deal with freedom? How do we guarantee freedom?
A: **Partial knowledge**: endorses freedom, because if the knowledge is not one, but there is more than one possibility to know something, then we are free.
**Absolute knowledge**: endorses truth, as it’s separated from all the others and in this isolation he defends the truth that he claims, refusing every other form of knowledge, like unorthodox.
Let’s consider every knowledge a partial knowledge, because this is how it is, no knowledge can claim to be the last, to say the last words on some topics, all the different logoi mash together and sometimes help eachother and sometimes transform different disciplines. Partial knowledge is that one that recognizes to be incomplete and valorizes the idea that more knowledge comes into the biggest one, because more perspectives is like when we have a room and a perspective is something to look through, it’s like windows, we open more and more windows and we have a bigger view, glans, view on things.

## Q: How is absoluteness of knowledge related to the idea that we have a total knowledge over an entity/phenomena?

## Q: What is platform doing on our existential structure?
A: Platforms has changed profoundly the way we recognize our identity, the relationship with others, the perception of space, time...
Being in the net has also to do with our way of **forming opinions**, cultivating beliefs, structuring them into theories... being in the net significantly influences our way of understanding the truth and how to relate with it. 

## Q: Difference between archetypical, prototypical and  stereotypical society?
A: In the **Archetypal society**, such as the Greek civilization, the relationship between knowledge and entities (things in the world) is approached with a specific **contemplative mindset**, which aims to comprehend the natural order and seeks to align the  laws governing this order with fundamental principles (referred to as “archè”); 
A **Prototypical society** represents a break from traditional values and principles (arché) and embraces a **notion of being limitless**, continually surpassing boundaries. The concept of "prototypical" comes from the Greek word πρῶτος (protos), meaning "the first", indicating a society that sees itself as pioneering, without constraints from past ideologies or divine principles; 
A **Stereotypical society** is characterized by rigid, repetitive patterns and generalizations that lack depth and personal engagement. A ”stereotype” is a general idea that everybody knows, something that remains on the surface.

## Q: On-life
A: In the online life (on-life) we can express mediumness trough 3 main channels, according to Heidegger:
1. misunderstanding (*equivoco*);
2. curiosity (*curiosità*);
3. chatter (*chiacchera*);

The above 3 are at the very bottom of the functioning among human beings, subjects, that keep their need to be part of something, so they get to have, on this on-life, this form of mediumness.

## Q: Isonomy vs isegory?
A: **Isonomy** (from greek "iso" meaning equal, and "nomos" meaning law) refers to **equality under the law**. This concept is fundamental in democratic societies and emphasizes that all individuals, regardless of their status or wealth, are subject to the same laws and legal processes. Isonomy ensures that no one is above the law and that everyone has equal protection and obligations under it. 
**Isegory** (from the Greek “iso" meaning equal, and "agora" meaning public space or marketplace) pertains to equal rights to speak in public forums. This concept is crucial in democratic societies as it ensures that every citizen has the same right to participate in public discourse, debate, and decision-making processes. Basically ensures freedom of speech and equal access to the platforms where public matters are discussed and decided. It aims to prevent any individual or group from monopolizing public dialogue and ensures diverse voices and perspectives are heard.

## Q: What happens to time and space online? What happens to asynchronous time online?
A: Being online we must say that alters our perception of identity, community and relationship, it offers us a flat, asynchronous time (read a message and reply after) and is detached, and independent from the duration of times in the world, that has night, days, opening and closing time, holidays, working days,...being on the net means to disconnect from our common time space reality and to enter into a narcissistic world built exclusively on our times and need. 

## Q: What is the difference between mechanical replies and human answers?
A: Human beings do not offer replies (replica: always the same, like at the
theatre, what makes it different from the others? Human interpretation).
Human beings offer answers, this is because they have access to the sphere of meaning and are capable of plastically reorganize their reasoning, rethinking it and themselves.

## Q: What/who is a human being, can this question be answered by machines?
We are something onthologically different from all the other libing beings? **Cartesio** said that *cogito ergo sum*: the **person thinks therefore he is**, but this answer does not address the initial question, what is cogito in the first place? 
**Kant**, same thing: he discussed our being as we are subjects, that through reason could exit from a state of minority that regards all the other living beings, through reason we are subject of history.
Many philosophers (also poets, writers, ...) made this attempt but nobody were able to say the last words, and indeed this very impossibility to be answered exhaustively restarts the question every time, and this is how philosophy and research works.

## Q: How is a human being, what is Heidegger’s answer? (answer: da sein, mit sein, selb sein, als sein)
A: Heidegger started to investigate this question from **da sein** [da zein], Not only being present but also being conscious of being present. Most of the philosophers asked: who is a human being? Heidegger put this question in this form: instead of asking who a man is, or what is, he rather asks how he is, how the human nature manifests itself as a phenomenon? according to Heidegger, the essence of the man is that he is not having an essence, but is always in the capability, possibility to become something else. Being present and being aware of it.
**Mit-sein** means "being with", with who? Others. He claims that we are born and at the same moment we have people around us, the fact that we grow (we have a life) means that
somebody took care of us which is an existential, it’s a way that human beings live their existence, caring for things and others.
**Selb-sein** means ”to be him/herself” (selb is ”self”), which is opposed
to ”als-sein”, which means ”to be in a role”. 

## Q: Project and programs difference?
A: We can have purposes that change during our life so we can start from a point and then change the path in between, still we get to the point but we cannot program it in advance. Programmed entities like algorithms, computers, machines in general or living beings follow programs. 
They both share the same prefix which is **pro** that **means in front**. **Gram means to write** so to write before, in advance, previously which is something written in the past.
We humans project things, because if something popout then we can change the path to arriva at that project, we deals with present and future while programs only pass and future.

## Q: Power
We can say ”potere” is a word that is at the same time: 
- a verb: we are able to do do something, we have the abilities and capabilities;
- a noun: things get more difficult... alter all, political, sociological and juridical definitions do not always agree. 
There are those who separate power from **violence** and those who consider violence an intense form of power. Sometimes power is associated to **law**, sometimes with **arbitrariness**. 

## Q: What is Hermeneutics?
A: The **art of interpretation**, it is important the idea of it because it’s a skill that machines do not have, machines can only calculate and pair but do not have the capacity to evaluate in a deeper way. To interpret something, we need text and context to give meaning and sense to words.
There are those who separate power from violence and those who consider violence an intense form of power. Sometimes power is associated to law sometimes with arbitrariness.

## Q: Equality and law, what is the difference between identical and equal?
A: The Equal is not the Same, because the Equal is always equal to somebody else, but in the difference. The sameness, instead, recalls an idea of identity, to be identical, it’s the same.
As human beings, we do not have ”same” human beings, we are equal, because in front of the law we have the same weight, but we have differences, so we cannot be treated everyone the same way, it would be unfair.

## Q: Machine memory and human memory.
A: There's a word **re-cordare** which contains cor which means heart. Because when we remember something we bring it back to the heart. Also machines have a memory but they cannot recordare because they have no hearts. The Human capacity of collecting data is limited, while algorithms have capacity of calculation/storage that is huge, but the most important point is that there is a **different intensity and quality in different memories**. A machine memory does not have any filter of importance, everything is at the same level, while in our memories when we remember we have memories they have intensity and quality that could differ from others.

## Q: What’s dromocracy?
A: We know that democracy is a slow activity and is opposed to the type of **democracy that requires technology** that is more similar to a dromocracy. Digital technology requires a dromocracy, because they move and develop very fast: the more they evolve fast, the more the rules need to be general, in order to be such they must be effective, if they go too much in detail they will be overgone after a little while, a balance is needed.

## Q: The principles of equality
A: 
- **Non-discrimination**: All individuals should be treated the same without discrimination based on race, gender, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics.
- **Equality of opportunity**: Everyone should have equal access to opportunities regardless of their personal or socio-economic circumstances. This means removing barriers that limit access to opportunities.
- **Equal treatment**: Treating all people with the same dignity and respect, without favoritism or unjust preferences.
- **Procedural fairness**: Ensuring fair and impartial processes and procedures that guarantee equal treatment in decisions and actions.
- **Distributive justice**: Concerns the fair distribution of resources, rewards, and benefits in society so that everyone can enjoy a dignified life and adequate opportunities.

These principles are essential for promoting an inclusive, fair, and rights-respecting society for all its members.

## Q: Freedom and law connection?
A: We use our freedom to go after aims, which are different from everybody, we have a general way of functioning intended to survive like other living beings, but the way we decided to live our lives is very complex and has many influences, the idea is that we have to find our way that is not the main way.
**Freedom is at the bottom of the juridical system**, because for example if a lion eats a man he does not to go to jail because he had no choice, he just followed his instinct.
Whereas as human beings we can choose if follow the good or bad path, our possibility to choose is what is at the bottom of our responsibility, we are **responsible of our actions because we can choose**.
